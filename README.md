> [!NOTE]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> highly inspired by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [LiveUI/Awesome](https://github.com/LiveUI/Awesome)

A awesome swift library for packaging [fluent icon](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons) into you app without any costs, no need to delete unused resources just use like SF Symbol but type safe, with nearly no build time increase compare to the original method provided by fluent icon team
